# Rules

## UI

### Directories

- `components/` - reusable UI pure components that can be used across different parts of the application.
- `containers/` - components that are aware of the application or UI, or other context.
- `contexts/` - React contexts and providers.
- `contracts/` - TypeScript types and interfaces that define the data structures and entities used in the UI. Application API is expected to follow these contracts.
- `hooks/` - custom React hooks for UI logic to be used across components.
- `layouts/` - layout components that define the overall structure of pages or sections.
- `modals/` - modal components for displaying overlay dialogs.
- `pages/` - components that represent full pages in the application.
- `shared/` - shared utilities and types that can be used across different parts of the UI.
